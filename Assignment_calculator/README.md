# Assignments
## JavaScript: Create a Simple Calculator 
### Objective:  
- Practice using JavaScript variables and functions. 
- Learn how to interact with HTML elements using JavaScript. 
 
### Instructions 
1. HTML Part: 
- Create an HTML form with: 
- Two input fields for numbers (for example, number1 and number2). 
- Four buttons for basic operations (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide). 
- A result display section (can be a div or a p tag). 
 
2. JavaScript Part (functions and variables): 
- Write JavaScript functions for each operation: add, subtract, multiply, and divide. 
- Inside each function: 
- Use getElementById() to retrieve the numbers from the input fields. For 
example: let number1 = parseFloat(document.getElementById('number1').value); 
- Perform the respective mathematical operation using variables. 
- Console.log the result of each function. 
- Display the result in the span with id result. (will be learn soon)
